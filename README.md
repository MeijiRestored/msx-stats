## Usage

Open the website with [this link](https://meijirestored.github.io/msx-stats/) and load in your ``stats.txt`` file.

The website will then parse various stats from the file and display them.

### How to get the stats.txt file

By default, Minesweeper X does not save the ``stats.txt`` file, you have to enable it manually.

Open Minesweeper X, go in the Extras tab, open Auto Options

![Auto Options menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MeijiRestored/msx-stats/main/assets/auto-options.png)

From this menu, check 'All' under Statistics (in orange). Do the same for every game mode (in red), as the statistics setting applies per game mode.

As you play minesweeper, Minesweeper X will fill in the ``stats.txt`` file, located in the same folder as the game executabe, with various stats, that you can read here!
